%uses a batch file ('batch_in') of notefiles and calculates the ff of a 16ms segment of the
%syllable, which is determined by the user
%the user enters the start of the segment by entering either the ms_from_start of the syllable
%or the % in the syllable

%this function uses parts of pick_notes and get_songs to pull out the relevant 16ms segment of the
%syllable of interest, calculates the auto-covariance of the segment, and then
%looks for the distance, in frequency, between the 0th lag and the first peak (does parabolic
%interpolation of the peak given three points)
